# simple-space-invaders

This is the final project I completed for the Google-sponsored Computer Science Computing Initiative (CSSI). I collaborated with one partner on this project: Dale Sanchez. 

For the creation of the project, we used the p5 javascript library to build the recreation of the well known game Space Invaders. The project runs how the original game would being much more simple in many ways. When running it the game starts and there will be a square at the bottom of the screen, in this case the player, capable of moving left and right as well as shooting upwards where rows of other squares, the aliens, will be moving down to attack. There are even three shields with health that blocks aliens upon contact with the aliens. The user has three lives and once all lives are lost, the game will end.

If you would like to setup and run this project, you can download the repository and open the index.html file in a web browser.
